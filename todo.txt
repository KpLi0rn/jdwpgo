# continue with low level investigations

- per thread control (implement)

  - suspend, resume, status, stop, interrupt, suspend count
  - investigate the above and resolve ambiguities in the oracle docs

- error handling at the protocol level

- stack trace

- look at breakpoint API and make sure there are no surprises

- this should be enough to implement a rudimentary debugger.

   - list threads
   - switch threads
   - go / stop program
   - break on class entry
